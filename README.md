# Flask CRUD Application

A web application built using Flask, a SQL database, and Bootstrap v5 for styling. This application allows users to
perform CRUD operations on a student database using the WampServer64 for SQL server. Built in Pycharm Community

## Introduction:

***

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a
  microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form
  validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.
* [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for storing, manipulating and
  retrieving data in
  databases. SQL is used to query a database, to insert records in a database, to update records in a database, to
  delete records from a database, to create new databases and new tables in a database, to create stored procedures in a
  database, to create views in a database, to set permissions on tables, procedures, and views, and so on.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first
  front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons,
  navigation, and other interface components.
* [WampServer64](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) is a Windows web development environment. It allows you to create web
  applications with Apache2, PHP, and the MySQL database. WampServer64 is available for Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP.
  It is licensed under the GNU/GPLv3.
* [Pycharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) is an integrated development
  environment
  (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. It is developed by JetBrains (formerly known
  as IntelliJ), and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition, and in a proprietary commercial edition.
